My Resume
Working on my resume, I'm still learning to code so I don't have any coding achievements to ad to the actual content yet.
Mostly just looking for tips on making it look better
Maybe a new colour pallet
Anything to make it look more interesting
Something I could add to impress employers who are looking for coders or not looking for coders.
